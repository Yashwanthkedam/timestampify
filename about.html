    <p class="mb-4">TimeStampify is a free, privacy-first tool to timestamp your content — built for creators, by a creator.</p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6">🎯 What It Does</h2>
    <p class="mt-2">Whether you're a poet, developer, podcaster, or a startup founder drafting ideas, TimeStampify lets you quickly generate cryptographic proof that your content existed at a specific point in time.</p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6">🔐 Why It Exists</h2>
    <p class="mt-2">The internet is fast, chaotic, and often unfair to original creators. TimeStampify exists so that individuals can protect their creative work without legal complexity, signup forms, or expensive tools. Just paste, upload, and download your proof — no strings attached.</p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6">👨‍💻 Who Made This</h2>
    <p class="mt-2">This project was created by a builder who believes in simple, beautiful, and privacy-respecting web tools. It’s currently free and open to feedback, love, and collaboration.</p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6">📬 Contact & Feedback</h2>
    <p class="mt-2">Got suggestions or want to contribute? You can reach out via GitHub or through our Ko-fi page when it goes live.</p>
